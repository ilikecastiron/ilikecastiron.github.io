      <h2>About Jack</h2>
      <p><p>He even has his own holiday. November 19th his Kilby STEM day 
	in the science community, one that many high schools will celebrate. 
	He earned his Bachelor of Science from the University of Illinois and earned his 
	Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from the University of 
	Wisconsin-Milwaukee. He was also a World War II Veteran. He worked as a Technician for 
	the Army, and when he was finished in the military, he went on to work as an Electrical 
	Engineer. He won the Nobel Prize in 2000 for his accomplishments and was one of the first 
	ones in his field to be awarded such an honor. The integrated circuit was also being manifested 
	in someone else’s mind around the same time that Kilby was working on his idea. The name of this 
	person is Robert Noyce, who was in California. They had the same idea of reducing the number of 
	components that go into computing, but Kilby was able to construct is idea into a real working piece 
	first. Noyce did ultimately design a more probable and useable device, but without Kilby’s initial 
	design, it could be possible that nobody was able to create tge same thing. </p></p>
      <p>The story of his invention of the integrated circuit is quite comical. He was a newer employee at Texas 
	Instruments, hardly a few months. It was during the common summer vacation time for the more tenured employees, 
	leaving Jack to stay at work, since he didn’t have the option to leave. With the extra time to himself he was able 
	to focus on his new idea. He was able to build a makeshift integrated circuit, and it is noted that without this 
	extra time alone, he possibly wouldn’t have the time to come up with the idea at all. This invention is what lead to 
	so many great things in our world. Cell phones, calculators, space travel and pretty much any electronic device to date. 
	He was able to fix the problem at the time; too many wires and components to realistically build a better computer design. 
	He was able to build the necessary parts onto a single piece and was the starting point at making electronics much smaller 
	than ever before. </p>
      <p>After his invention of the integrated circuit, Kilby also helped invent the portable calculator and the thermal printer. He 
	had roughly 50 patents to his name. He was able to show off the use of his integrated circuit in the portable calculators that
	he was able to help create, ultimately being a huge breakthrough for Texas Instruments. He is not the most famous person on the 
	list of our Computer/Computing forefathers, but his invention has to be one of the most significant, in terms of what has been 
	accomplished since its creation. Kilby was also someone that you would not guess he would or has won the Nobel Prize, due to how 
	humble of an individual he was. When he won the award, and gave his speech, he said that “If Robert Noyce were alive, he would be 
	up here with me accepting this award”. To me that goes to show how modest and kind of a man he was. The two of them are often 
	thought of as the co-inventers of the integrated circuit. Even with him winning the Nobel Prize, it took him 42 years to be awarded 
	that honor. </p>
      <p>Famous quotes by Jack:</p>
      <blockquote>
         <p class="fun">"My own interest developed because I thought it was a fascinating subject and something I wanted to pursue."</p>
	 <p class="fun">"It's true that the original idea was mine, but what you see today is the work of probably tens of thousands of the 
	 world's best engineers, all concentrating on improving the product, reducing the cost, things of that sort."</p>
