        <p>Jack Kilby was an American Electrical Engineer famous for his 
	invention of the integrated circuit in 1958. He was one of a few 
	that worked to create what we know as today as the microchip. He 
	invented the first working one, and without his work the computing 
	world could be completely different. He helped invent the handheld 
	calculator after to show the usefulness of the newly made circuit 
	and helped invent the thermal printer as well. Kilby was born in 
	Great Bend, Kansas in 1923 and was drawn to the interests of 
	electronics from a storm that struck his town when he was young. 
	His father worked for the local power company and used radio to 
	communicate with people that lost power. Being able to see how useful 
	radio was, Jack was inspired by electronics from then on, and that is 
	the beginning of Kilbyâ€™s journey into the Electrical Engineering field.</p>
